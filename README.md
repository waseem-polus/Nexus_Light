Maneuver the different levels as fast as possible to reach the nexus cube and move on to the next level all while avoiding the deadly lasers.  
Made in Unity.

## What I Learned?
- I was introduced to object oriented principles such as encapsulation and inheritance.
- I became familiar with game design concepts such as level design and player feedback loops.
- Throughout the duration of this project, I was able to improve my pixel art skills, particularly animation. 

I revisted some of the early animations I made a month later and this was the result.

## How It Can Be Improved?
This game was a great learning opportunity and I plan to revisit it again someday to level it up to the next stage. Features that I'm hoping to add in the future include:
- Best time leaderboard per level. This is a speedrunning game afterall :D
- More levels
- Music and SFX
