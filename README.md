In this game, players must navigate through various levels as quickly as possible, avoiding lasers and making their way to the nexus cube to progress to the next level. Test your speed and reflexes with this challenging and exciting game.

## What I Learned?
- I was introduced to object oriented principles such as encapsulation and inheritance.
- I became familiar with game design concepts such as level design and player feedback loops.
- Throughout the duration of this project, I was able to improve my pixel art skills, particularly animation. 

I revisted some of the early animations I made a month later and this was the result.

## How It Can Be Improved?
This game was a great learning opportunity and I plan to revisit it again someday to level it up to the next stage. Features that I'm hoping to add in the future include:
- Best time leaderboard per level. This is a speedrunning game afterall :D
- More levels
- Music and SFX
